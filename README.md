# GitDrago

Custom built version control implemented in Python.
This was done purely to gain a better uunderstanding of how git works. By using `./drac` followed by the git command. 

## Acknowledgment

GitDrago was made by following this ![tutorial](https://wyag.thb.lt/#orgdefb891). To get a better understanding of the different areas that git usesm- Working, Staging, and Repository, I found ![this](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-git-index-4821a0765cf) to be quite helpful as it illustrates the relation between index, objects and refs quite concisely.
